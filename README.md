### Philosophy & Focus

Anvil is specifically designed for the **right side of the engineering problem** - the **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** that form the architectural foundation of software systems.

Product development has two distinct sides:
- **Left Side (Creative Design Space)**: Experiences and Features - the domain of Product Managers and UX designers
- **Right Side (Technical Implementation)**: Technical Capabilities and Enablers - the domain of Engineers and Architects

Anvil focuses exclusively on the right side, helping engineering teams define, organize, and manage the technical capabilities that enable product experiences. A new platform is coming soon for the left side that will marry **Experiences and Features** (Product Managers) with **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** (Engineers) to build the architectural runway needed to support exceptional user experiences.

### Core Principles

#### Components-Capabilities-Enablers-Requirements Model
- **Components** are logical software systems or applications that contain capabilities
- **Capabilities** represent high-level business functions within components that deliver value to users
- **Enablers** are technical implementations that realize capabilities through specific functionality
- **Requirements** define specific functional and non-functional needs within enablers

#### Quality and Governance
- All development follows strict approval workflows
- Pre-condition verification prevents bypassing of quality gates
- State-based progression ensures proper task sequencing

#### Documentation-First Approach
- Specifications are created before implementation
- Technical diagrams and designs guide development
- All artifacts are version controlled and traceable
